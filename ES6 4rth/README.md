## JavaScript (ES6) Advanced Concepts Assignment 4 
I just finished it. The important topics of this assignment and their definitions are detailed below. I have taken these from different websites and documents.  
**call()**  
The call() method of Function instances calls this function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. (MDN);  
**apply()**  
The apply() method lets you write a method that can be used on different objects. (W3schools)  
**bind()**  
The bind() method of Function instances creates a new function that, when called, calls this function with its this keyword set to the provided value, and a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. (MDN)  
**Closure**  
In JavaScript, closure provides access to the outer scope of a function from inside the inner function, even after the outer function has closed.  (programiz)  
**OOP**  
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that uses classes and objects to model real-world things like data and behavior. A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and methods an object can have, while an object is a specific instance created from that class.   (geeksforgeeks)
