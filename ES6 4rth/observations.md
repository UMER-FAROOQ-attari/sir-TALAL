##  How to run this code?   
1 download the files.  
2 open app.js in VS code.  
3 Run this command in terminal.   
**node app.js**

##  My Observations  
I learn Call() , apply() and bind()  
The most important thing I couldn't understand without code 
And that's it **OOP**
Finally, I would thanks to thank Sir Talal for explaining this to us.
